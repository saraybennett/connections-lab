    <h1>i carry your heart</h1>
    <h2>a low res ima summer '25 final project</h2>
    <img class="one" src="./heart.jpeg" />
    <p> I wrote ‘take this heart and make it yours’ for the prompt of ‘fun house’ for Adoptee Voices. It explores the
        tension between wanting something so very badly (to reunite with my birth mother) but also being terrified of
        that very same thing. It draws upon the classic horror story of Bloody Mary—the way children will still call her
        name three times, even knowing what could come through the mirror. <br>

        I expanded on this piece throughout my first semester of grad school; I wanted to take my writing and give it a
        physical form. I created a life-size scene from the flash piece which centers on an 8x4 foot mirror that has the
        words ‘mother, mother, mother’ painted in red. The work is accompanied by an audio recording of me reading the
        piece that is scored by Alaine. <br>

        This work would not have been possible without a team, from my fabrication queen Katie to my soldering queens
        Queenie & Veyda to everyone who helped me put the frame together, especially Nate and David, to Jeremy for
        helping me get the mirror, to Alexandros and our ‘motherland’ corner and access to the mfta, to those who helped
        me with illustrator: Ash and Chris, to the wonderful fab staff as well as my instructors, the residents, and
        everyone else who helped—I couldn’t have done it without y’all ❣️<br></p>
